# flutter_library

Description:

This project aims to help Flutter beginners.

In 'lib' you will find separated small web apps to show different methods, as simple as possible. One file per app.

I find this helpful sometimes, to see only the code used for a certain method.

Run the different apps by right clicking on the dart file and then click 'Start debugging'.
